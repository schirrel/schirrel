### Ahoy!

I'm a UI developer, but you can call me a front-ender.
I am a Jack of all Trades, but i'm kinda marteres CSS, Vanilla JS and HTML.

I'm focused on bring ux to you ui and make it looks both pretty and more useful.

Current i'm of the i.t. world as i am taking a time to know myself as well as help out my family in a local small business.

### CSS
My biggest goal and passion is CSS, i have a challenge's repo with things that you may learn about CSS, and some of then are thing that i bet you thought u couldn't make without JS.

### Stuff
I did some things i'm proud of:
- [Request](https://github.com/schirrel) - Request is a wrapper of the fetch api to you to get more familiar.
- [My Own Personal Page](https://github.com/schirrel/schirrel.github.io) - I know its odd, but in my page i was free to try new thinks, and also to toast in a trash what i dont like about web developement. My page has SPA, Routes, Translating and a Markdown Blog, and guess whats WITHOUT A JS FRAMEWORK (even jQuery). Also most part of the things a pretty much css only.
- [CSS Fully Funcional Dashboas](https://github.com/schirrel/css-admin-template)
