### Ahoy!
I'm a UI developer, but you can call me a front-ender. I am a Jack of all Trades, but i kinda mastered CSS, Vanilla JS and HTML. I'm focused on bring ux to your ui and make it both pretty and useful.

#### CSS
My biggest goal and passion is CSS, i have a challenge's repo with things that you may learn about CSS, and some of then are thing that i bet you thought u couldn't make without JS.
[The challenges](https://github.com/schirrel/css-challenges)

### Stuff
I did some things i'm proud of:
- [pg-connection](https://github.com/schirrel/pg-connection) - Simple PotgreSQL wrapper for nodejs.
- [Request](https://github.com/schirrel/request) - Request is a wrapper of the fetch api to you to get more familiar.
- [My Own Personal Page](https://github.com/schirrel/schirrel.github.io) - I know its odd, but in my page i was free to try new thinks, and also to toast in a trash what i dont like about web developement. My page has SPA, Routes, Translating and a Markdown Blog, and guess whats WITHOUT A JS FRAMEWORK (even jQuery). Also most part of the things a pretty much css only.

### Stack
I can program anything, because i love to code and learn. But i'm already know and enjoy: AngularJS, VueJS, VanillaJS, Java, CSS+HTML, NodeJS
