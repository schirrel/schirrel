### Ahoy!

I'm a UI developer, but you can call me a front-ender.
I am a Jack of all Trades, but i'm kinda martered CSS, Vanilla JS and HTML.

I'm focused on bring ux to your ui and make it both pretty and useful.

Current i'm of the business as i am taking a time to know myself, heal my mind, as well as help out my family in a local small business.

### CSS
My biggest goal and passion is CSS, i have a challenge's repo with things that you may learn about CSS, and some of then are thing that i bet you thought u couldn't make without JS.

[The challenges](https://github.com/schirrel/css-challenges)


### Stuff
I did some things i'm proud of:
- [Request](https://github.com/schirrel) - Request is a wrapper of the fetch api to you to get more familiar.
- [My Own Personal Page](https://github.com/schirrel/schirrel.github.io) - I know its odd, but in my page i was free to try new thinks, and also to toast in a trash what i dont like about web developement. My page has SPA, Routes, Translating and a Markdown Blog, and guess whats WITHOUT A JS FRAMEWORK (even jQuery). Also most part of the things a pretty much css only.
- [CSS Fully Funcional(ish) Dashboard](https://github.com/schirrel/css-admin-template)


### Stack
I can program anything, because i love to code and learn. 
But i'm already know and enjoy:
- AngularJS (Hold on boy, it still a good framework)
- VueJS (My bae latetly)
- VanillaJS (nothing is better than)
- Java
- CSS+HTML ( i am proud how good at the basics i am)
- NodeJS
